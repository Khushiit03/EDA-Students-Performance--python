# EDA-Students-Performance--python
This project explores a dataset on students' academic performance using Python. The goal is to uncover insights, detect patterns, and analyze the impact of various factors like gender, parental education, lunch types, and test preparation on studentsâ€™ scores in math, reading, and writing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Students Performance Dataset - Python
Objective:
The objective of this EDA is to analyze and understand the various factors affecting students' academic performance. The dataset includes variables such as gender, parental level of education, test preparation course, lunch type, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

âœ… Key Steps Involved in the Analysis:
1)Importing Libraries & Loading the Dataset
Utilized libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data handling and visualization.

2)Data Inspection
Checked dataset structure, shape, and types.
Identified missing values and data quality issues (if any).

3)Descriptive Statistics
Analyzed summary statistics for all numeric columns.
Checked distributions and central tendencies (mean, median, mode).

4)Data Visualization
Used bar plots, box plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
Explored relationships between:
 Gender and average scores
 Parental education and student performance
 Impact of test preparation on scores
 Lunch type and student performance

5)Correlation Analysis
Generated heatmap to visualize correlations between math, reading, and writing scores.

6)Insights & Observations
Girls tend to perform better in reading and writing.
Students who completed the test preparation course scored significantly higher.
Higher parental education levels are often associated with better performance.
Standard lunch is linked to better student outcomes compared to free/reduced lunch.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion:
This EDA helped uncover valuable insights into the academic performance of students and the influence of various socio-demographic and preparatory factors. These insights can assist educators and policymakers in making data-driven decisions to enhance educational outcomes.
